# Shopping List Application (TDD + CI/CD)

This is an Android application that stores shopping lists in a Room database, fetches shopping item images from the Pixabay API, and is built using the MVI (Model-View-Intent) architecture. The app implements Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## Features

- **Room Database**: Store shopping list items with local persistence.
- **Pixabay API Integration**: Fetch and display images for shopping items.
- **MVI Architecture**: Implements Model-View-Intent architecture for cleaner, testable code.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Application is developed using TDD to ensure high test coverage and code quality.
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing, report & artifact generation and deployment using CI/CD pipelines.
- **XML for UI Design**: Uses XML for designing the user interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Kotlin
- **Architecture**: MVI (Model-View-Intent)
- **Database**: Room (SQLite abstraction)
- **API**: Pixabay (to fetch item images)
- **UI**: XML layouts
- **Testing**: JUnit, Espresso (for UI testing), Mockito
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
